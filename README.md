## Usage

First, add Player to your App variables. Insert the path to the file to be played in `new()`

New takes an enum called InputMode. This lets you play a file from a filepath (`String`) or with bytes (`Vec<u8>`)

```rust
struct MyApp {
    player: Player,
}

impl Default for MyApp {
    fn default() -> Self {
        Self {
            player: Player::from_path("file_path"),
        }
    }
}
```

For bytes, enter the following line instead:

```rust
player: Player::from_bytes(bytes),
```

For transcriptions: Set up an async block to allow for asynchronous tokio functions

```rust
fn main() {
    let rt = Runtime::new().unwrap();
    let _ = rt.block_on(async {
        eframe::run_native(
            "Player Example",
            NativeOptions::default(),
            Box::new(|_| Ok(Box::new(MyApp::default()))),
        )
    });
}
```

Now, under the update function, add this line to display the player:

```rust
self.player.ui(ui);
```

For faster transcription, run with the `release` flag

## Examples

To play your own files, clone/download this repository and use:
`cargo run --example main --release`
